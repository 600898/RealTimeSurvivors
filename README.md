# RTS
This project was an excercice to create a more data driven system for handling entities data.
I tried copying the Entity Component System structure, where all data for entities are located inside lists instead of inside objects and is iterated through on runtime.

This project uses the .NET version of Godot 3.6.2 for everything rendering.
