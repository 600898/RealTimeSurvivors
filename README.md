# RTS
This project was an excercice to create a game using the "ECS"-structure, where every entity in the game is defined by components that are stored inside collections.
Every component an entity has, gets read/written to by different systems in the main game world-loop.

The concept is loosely based around the Real Time Strategy, and survivors-like gameplay.
You can create buildings and produce units, which are commandable, using generated resources.
The survivors part is just spawning enemies and choosing a reward at the end of the wave.

# How to run and play the game
The game is made using the .NET version of the godot game engine.
It specifically uses the 3.6.2 (Stable) version, as it has the oppurtunity to export .NET projects to the web.

The Visual Studio Solution for the source code is also included.
